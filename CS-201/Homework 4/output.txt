Testing Infix to Prefix

Prefix form of 7-3/2+1-9/3+9 is +-+-7/321/939   OR  -7+/32-1+/939 OR --7+/321+/939 OR +-7/32+-1/939
Prefix form of 9-2*3/8+(6-2)*3 is +-9/*238*-623 OR  -9+/*238*-623 
Prefix form of 5-(3+9)/3*4-1 is --5*/+39341 OR -5-*/+39341
Prefix form of 3+2-1+9+2-1+3 is +-++-+3219213 OR +3-2+1+9-2+13
Prefix form of 6-2*(4+2)-9/3+6 is +--6*2+42/936 OR -6-*2+42+/936
